<div class="paragraph"><h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                                Violent crime consists of five criminal offenses: <li>murder and non-negligent manslaughter</li>
                                <li> rape</li> 
                                <li>robbery</li>
                                <li>aggravated assault</li>
                                <li>gang violence</li>
                                <li> property crime consists of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.</li>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <h3>PUNISHMENTS</h3>
                                The law allows for the harshest possible penalties for violent felonies. A wide range of penalties is possible for each particular crime, and sentences differ widely depending on the circumstances of each case.
<ul>
<li>Death.  The death penalty, or capital punishment, is the most severe penalty possible and is imposed only against those convicted of murder, the most serious of violent felonies. (However, federal law also allows for the death penalty for treason crimes.) While not all states allow for capital punishment, those that do allow for it only in cases of murder. </li>

<li>Prison. Incarceration is a common penalty for those convicted of a violent felony. Felony offenses always have a potential prison sentence of a year or more in jail. Depending on the particular crime involved, a conviction for violent felony could result in a sentence of years, decades, or even life in prison.</li>

<li>Fines. Violent felonies also come with significant fines, though these too will differ depending on the circumstances of the case. A fine for a single conviction could be as much as $50,000, though much larger amounts are also possible.</li>

<li>Restitution. A person convicted of a violent felony can also be required to pay restitution in addition to any fines. Restitution is paid to a victim to compensate that person for any medical expenses or other costs involved. Court costs or costs of prosecution can also be made a part of a restitution order.</li>

<li>Probation. Some people convicted of a violent felony can be sentenced to probation in addition to, or instead of, fines or prison time. Probation usually lasts at least a year or longer, and during that time the person on probation must be sure to regularly report to a probation officer, stay out of trouble with the law, pay all fines and restitution, and meet any other conditions the court imposes.</li>
